JWT Token Generation:

1. Verify that JWT tokens are generated correctly on the server-side upon successful authentication (login).
Ensure that tokens include necessary information (like user ID, roles, expiration) and are securely signed using a secret key or key pair.
Token Handling in Frontend:

2. Implement logic in your frontend (React) application to store tokens securely (e.g., in local storage or a secure cookie).
Ensure tokens are attached to API requests where authorization is required (typically in the Authorization header as Bearer <token>).
Backend Authorization:

3. On the backend (Spring Boot), configure security filters or middleware to validate incoming JWT tokens.
Ensure endpoints requiring authentication check the validity and permissions encoded in the token.
Testing and Debugging:

4. Test the authentication flow thoroughly, including login, token issuance, token refresh (if applicable), and API access.
Use tools like browser developer tools (Network tab for API requests, Console for errors) and backend logs to debug any issues encountered during authentication.
